Add loader for ParmGroup

Factor larger implementations to src/*.cpp (e.g. load, io,)

Resolve different report convention in app/OriAnalysis

Add Conventions ability to report +++... style strings (to/from string?)


Perhaps create subdirectory for main application programs

	/app - e.g. OriAnalysis

For load file format, perhaps include convention used. E.g. by either
a code, or by explicit values of Convention instance.
